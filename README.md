# PITEST
NASA/Cray PITEST, and same with Intel HPF mods.

As for the documentation, yeah, I was bored shitless.  Just finished a contract involving a Meridian SL-100, in between, wouldn't be doing call accounting on the same for some months yet...

This should run on anything with ANSI FORTRAN-77 and 64 bit floating point, well, anything but the ETA-10 at Ames that killed Control Data.
