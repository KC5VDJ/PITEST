# PITEST
NASA/Cray PITEST, and same with Intel HPF mods.

As for the documentation, yeah, I was bored shitless.  Just finished a contract involving a Meridian SL-100, in between, wouldn't be doing call accounting on the same for some months yet...

This should run on anything with ANSI FORTRAN-77 and 64 bit (or 60 bit with at least 46 bits of mantissa) floating point, well, anything but the ETA-10 at Ames that killed Control Data.  ("It eventually ran"?  Yeah, but...  Face it, despite a few forward thinking concepts (inspired by Mach and Plan-9?), which were there, the suits at CDC cursed it from the beginning)

You know, thinking of the ETA-10 thing being cursed from the beginning...  What do you think Chippewa Falls was about?  They didn't want another wildcatter doing better than them.

A notable POS, Eddie Chiles, once explained wildcatters to me, and it fits.  Cray was a wildcatter.  A wildcatter was rarely acting dumbfuck cowboy.  Educated people making educated guesses good enough to bet the farm on it, when traditionalists scoff. A bit of a wildcatter myself.

Energy Park was simple crosstown traffic.  A leash.  Lemme guess, short enough to require same day meetings, but long enough to waste half a day every time one is required, just in transit?  A leash.

With Chippewa Falls, Cray actually forced meetings to be meaningful, I would imagine.
